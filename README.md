## Purpose :
Read all the text files in the given directory,
building an in memory representation of the files and their contents,
and then give a command prompt at which interactive searches can be performed.


An example session might look like:
$ scala test.SimpleSearch /foo/bar 14 files read in directory /foo/bar search>
search> to be or not to be filename1 : 100%
filename2 : 95% search>
search> cats
no matches found search> :quit
$


## Ranking
● The rank score must be 100% if a file contains all the words
● It must be 0% if it contains none of the words
● It should be between 0 and 100 if it contains only some of the words ­ but the exact


## Requirement:
